# Day 1 Python Tutorial Exercises

Welcome to the exercises for Day 1 of your Python tutorial! These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in "An Informal Introduction to Python" (Sections 3.1 and 3.2), including using Python as a calculator, working with numbers, text (strings), lists, and basic programming with loops. Follow the instructions, try the exercises, and use the example solutions as a guide.

## Exercise 1: Using Python as a Calculator (Numbers)
**Objective**: Practice basic arithmetic operations.

### Instructions
Write Python code to calculate the following:
1. The sum of 15 and 27.
2. The product of 4 and 6.
3. The result of 20 divided by 4.
4. The remainder when 17 is divided by 5 (use the `%` operator).

**Expected Output**:
```
42
24
5.0
2
```

## Exercise 2: Working with Text (Strings)
**Objective**: Practice string operations like concatenation and indexing.

### Instructions
- Create a string variable `greeting` with the value `"Hello"`.
- Concatenate it with your name (e.g., `"Alice"`) to form a new string and print it.
- Print the first character of `greeting` using indexing.
- Print the last character using a negative index.

**Expected Output**:
```
Hello Alice
H
o
```

## Exercise 3: Manipulating Lists
**Objective**: Practice creating, indexing, slicing, and modifying lists.

### Instructions
- Create a list `numbers` with the values `[3, 7, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Print the second item (index 1).
- Slice the list to get items from index 1 to 3 and print the result.
- Replace the third item (index 2) with 10 and print the updated list.
- Add the number 25 to the end of the list using `append()` and print the final list.

**Expected Output**:
```
7
[7, 12, 15]
[3, 7, 10, 15, 20]
[3, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25]
```

## Exercise 4: First Steps Towards Programming (Loop)
**Objective**: Practice a simple loop to generate a sequence.

### Instructions
- Write a program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones), starting with 0 and 1.
- Stop when the number exceeds 50.


**Expected Output**:
```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

## Tips for Success
